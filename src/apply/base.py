"""Applicator abstraction + per-ATS registry.

Most of the form-filling is generic (see fields.py). An Applicator's job is the
ATS-specific bits: recognizing a job and deriving its application-form URL.
`submit()` stays unimplemented at this layer on purpose — submission is driven
by the runner/CLI so it can honor the user's review-vs-auto mode and log every
attempt.
